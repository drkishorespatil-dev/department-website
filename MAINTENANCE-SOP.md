# Standard Operating Procedure — Department Website

**Department of Pharmacology**
Government Medical College & Hospital, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar

This document explains how to keep the department website up to date.
It assumes no knowledge of programming. Every task below is done in a web
browser; nothing needs to be installed on any computer.

---

## 1. How the website works

The website is made of ordinary files kept in an online folder called a
**repository** (or "repo") on GitHub. A service called **Vercel** watches that
repository. Whenever a file changes, Vercel automatically rebuilds the website
and publishes it, usually within one minute.

```
   You edit a file on GitHub   →   Vercel notices   →   Website updates
```

There is nothing to "upload to the server" and no password-protected control
panel. Changing the website means changing a file on GitHub.

### Where things are kept

| File or folder | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | All page content and the structure of every tab |
| `index.css` | Colours, fonts, spacing — the appearance |
| `index.js` | Faculty list, courses, quiz questions, slideshow behaviour |
| `assets/notices.json` | **Notice board entries** |
| `assets/faculty/` | Faculty photographs |
| `assets/gallery/` | Event and facility photographs |
| `assets/gallery/extra/` | The large photo wall on the Gallery tab |
| `assets/awards/` | Award photographs and press cuttings |
| `backend/` | Optional server for ADR report storage |

---

## 2. Accounts you must have

| Service | Purpose | Who should own it |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub** | Stores the website files | The department, not an individual |
| **Vercel** | Publishes the website | The department, not an individual |

Both accounts should ultimately be registered to a **departmental email
address** that the department will keep permanently, not to the personal email
of any one doctor or resident.

> **Current position:** the website was built under a personal account while
> departmental approval was pending, and is to be transferred to the department.
> **Section 12 sets out how.** Until that transfer is complete, the department
> does not control its own website. Treat it as an outstanding item.

### Critical — before any handover

1. Record the login email and password of both accounts in the department's
   confidential records.
2. GitHub requires **two-factor authentication**. When it is switched on,
   GitHub shows a list of **recovery codes**. Print them and keep them with the
   department records. Without these, the account becomes unreachable the day
   the registered mobile number leaves the department.
3. Ensure at least **two** staff members know where these records are kept.

## 3. Posting a notice on the notice board

This is the most common task. It needs no knowledge of code.

1. Open the repository on **github.com**
2. Click the `assets` folder, then click the file `notices.json`
3. Click the **pencil icon** (top right) to edit
4. Copy an existing block and change it. Each notice looks like this:

```json
    {
      "date": "2026-08-15",
      "tag": "Examination",
      "title": "Second MBBS internal assessment schedule",
      "body": "Timetable displayed on the departmental notice board.",
      "link": "assets/documents/ia-schedule.pdf",
      "linkText": "Download timetable (PDF)"
    }
```

- `date` must be written **year-month-day**, as in `2026-08-15`
- `tag` is the small coloured label. Use words like `Examination`, `Event`,
  `Award`, `Achievement`, `Circular`
- `link` and `linkText` are optional — delete both lines if there is no
  attachment. If you keep them, remember to remove the comma at the end of
  the `body` line
- Put a **comma between notices**, but never after the last one
5. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**

Notices sort themselves by date automatically. Newest appears first.
The same notices also feed the scrolling "What's New" strip on the home page.

> **If the notice board goes blank**, the file has a punctuation error — almost
> always a missing or extra comma. See section 9 to undo the change.

---

## 4. Adding photographs

### To the photo wall on the Gallery tab

1. Open `assets` → `gallery` → `extra` and note the highest numbered file
   (for example `photo-44.jpeg`)
2. Rename your new photographs on your computer to continue the sequence:
   `photo-45.jpeg`, `photo-46.jpeg`, and so on. Use lower case and the same
   `.jpeg` ending
3. On GitHub, inside that folder, click **Add file → Upload files**, drag the
   photographs in, and click **Commit changes**
4. Open `index.js`, click the pencil icon, and find this line near the middle:

```js
const PHOTO_WALL_COUNT = 44;
```

   Change `44` to the new highest number, then **Commit changes**

### To a captioned gallery group

1. Upload the photograph to `assets/gallery/`
2. Open `index.html`, click the pencil icon, and use **Ctrl + F** to find the
   heading of the group you want (for example `Facilities & Infrastructure`)
3. Copy one complete block that looks like this and change the file name and
   the caption:

```html
            <figure class="gf-card">
              <img src="assets/gallery/YOUR-PHOTO.jpg" alt="Describe the photograph" loading="lazy">
              <figcaption>The caption shown under the photograph</figcaption>
            </figure>
```

4. **Commit changes**

Always write a meaningful `alt` description. It is what visually impaired
visitors hear, and the department website is expected to be accessible.

---

## 5. Changing the home page slideshow

1. Upload the photograph to `assets/gallery/`
2. Open `index.html` and find `<div class="hero-carousel"` near the top
3. Each slide is one block like this:

```html
              <figure class="hc-slide" role="group" aria-roledescription="slide" aria-label="1 of 6">
                <img src="assets/dept-group-photo.jpg" alt="Describe the photograph">
                <figcaption class="hc-caption">
                  <span class="hc-tag">Our Department</span>
                  <h2>Department of Pharmacology</h2>
                  <p>Faculty &amp; Residents — Government Medical College &amp; Hospital</p>
                </figcaption>
              </figure>
```

4. To **add** a slide, copy a whole block and change the image and text.
   To **remove** one, delete the whole block from `<figure` to `</figure>`
5. **Commit changes**

The arrows, the dots and the automatic timing adjust themselves to the number
of slides. Nothing else needs changing.

## 6. Updating faculty and staff

When a faculty member joins or leaves, two places need attention.

**The Faculty tab** — in `index.html`, find the heading `Teaching Faculty` and
copy or delete one `<div class="faculty-card">` block.

**The CV tab** — in `index.js`, find the list beginning `const facultyProfiles`.
Each person is one entry:

```js
  { id: "rathod", name: "Dr. Arati Vitthal Rathod", designation: "Assistant Professor", group: "Assistant Professor", photo: "assets/faculty/rathod.jpg" },
```

- `group` must be exactly one of: `Professor`, `Associate Professor`,
  `Assistant Professor`, `Senior Resident` — this drives the filter buttons
- `photo` must match a real file in `assets/faculty/`
- A longer `cv: { ... }` section is optional. Without it, the person still
  appears in the directory with a note that the detailed CV is awaited

Remember to update the **Total Teaching Members** count on the Faculty tab.

---

## 7. Correcting text anywhere on the site

1. Open `index.html` on GitHub
2. Click the **pencil icon**
3. Press **Ctrl + F** and search for the words you want to change
4. Edit only the words between the angle brackets. Do not delete anything that
   looks like `<p>` or `</div>`
5. **Commit changes**

---

## 8. Checking that a change worked

1. Wait about one minute after committing
2. Open the website and press **Ctrl + Shift + R** to force a fresh copy
3. If nothing changed, open **vercel.com**, go to the project, open
   **Deployments**, and check the newest entry says **Ready**. If it says
   **Error**, see section 9

---

## 9. Undoing a mistake

Nothing done on this website is permanent. Every version ever published is kept.

**To put the previous version back immediately:**

1. Open **vercel.com** and select the project
2. Click **Deployments**
3. Find the last entry that worked, click the **⋯** menu beside it
4. Choose **Promote to Production**

The website reverts within seconds. Then fix the file at leisure and commit again.

**To see what was changed and by whom**, open the repository on GitHub and click
**Commits**. Every change is listed with its date and author.

---

## 10. Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) reports

The Patient Corner contains an ADR reporting form. **Confirm how it has been
configured before relying on it.**

- If the site is published as static pages only, submitted reports are kept in
  the visitor's own browser and **do not reach the department**
- For reports to arrive, the form must either be connected to a forwarding
  service that emails the department, or the site must be hosted with the
  included `backend/` server running

If the `backend/` server is used, the administrator key **must** be changed from
its default value before the site is public. It is set with the `ADMIN_KEY`
setting described in `README.md`.

Check with whoever deployed the site which arrangement is in place, and record
the answer here:

> ADR reports currently go to: _________________________________

---

## 11. Periodic checks

| How often | Task |
|---|---|
| Monthly | Post new notices; remove notices that have expired |
| Each term | Update faculty, residents and the Total Teaching Members count |
| Every six months | Click through every tab and check no photograph is missing |
| Yearly | Update the copyright year in the footer of `index.html` |
| Yearly | Confirm the GitHub and Vercel account recovery details are current |
| On handover | Transfer both accounts and update section 12 below |

---

## 12. Transferring the website to the department

Do this once departmental approval is in place. It takes about twenty minutes
and the website stays online throughout.

### Before you start

The department needs its own **GitHub account** and its own **Vercel account**,
both registered to a departmental email address, with two-factor authentication
switched on and the recovery codes printed (section 2).

### Step 1 — Transfer the repository

1. The outgoing owner opens the repository on github.com
2. **Settings** → scroll to **Danger Zone** → **Transfer ownership**
3. Enter the department's GitHub username and the repository name to confirm
4. The department account receives an invitation and must **accept** it

Everything moves: all files, the complete history of changes, and a redirect
from the old address so existing links keep working.

### Step 2 — Re-create the deployment

The transfer does **not** carry the Vercel connection across. The department
must publish the site from its own Vercel account:

1. Sign in to **vercel.com** as the department
2. **Add New → Project**, connect the department's GitHub, import the repository
3. Framework Preset **Other**; leave build command and output directory empty
4. **Deploy**

### Step 3 — Retire the old deployment

Once the department's copy is confirmed working, the outgoing owner deletes
the old Vercel project. Two live copies of the same website will otherwise
drift apart and confuse everyone, including search engines.

### Step 4 — Update the published address

**Unless a custom domain is in use, the web address changes at this point.**
A `.vercel.app` address belongs to the account that created it. Any address
printed on a letterhead, notice board, poster or QR code must be reissued.

> **This is avoidable.** If a custom domain is configured *before* the transfer,
> the public address never changes — the department simply repoints the same
> domain at its own deployment, and every printed link and QR code keeps
> working. If the site is to carry a permanent address, arrange the domain
> **before** anything is printed.

### Step 5 — Record the change

Update section 2 and the responsibility table below, change the passwords, and
confirm the department holds the recovery codes.

---

## 13. Responsibility

| Role | Name | Contact |
|---|---|---|
| Faculty in charge of the website | | |
| Second person with account access | | |
| Department email on record | pharmacgmca@gmail.com | |

Keep this table filled in. When either person leaves the department, update it
and change the account passwords the same week.

---

## 14. If something cannot be fixed

Commit nothing further and do not delete files in an attempt to repair it.
Use section 9 to restore the last working version first — that always succeeds —
and only then seek help. The repository holds the complete history, so no work
is ever lost.
